==========

A collection of Algorithms implemented to help study for CS 520

Everything works using STDIN and STDOUT.  File handling is tedious and I'd much rather pipe and redirect.

Example Usage:
$ cd sorting
$ make
$ echo "3 5 1 2 4 9 7 9 3" | ./bubblesort
$ cat data/002.A-100.txt | ./bubblesort > 100-sorted.txt
